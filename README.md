# Hand Gesture Recognition 

## About the Project

This is a simple application of Convolution Neural Networks combined with background ellimination to detect different hand gestures. A background ellimination algorithm extracts the hand image from webcam and uses it to train as well predict the type of gesture that is. More information about the algorithm can be found below.
